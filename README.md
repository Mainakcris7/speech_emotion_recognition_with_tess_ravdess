# Speech Emotion Recognition (TESS + RAVDESS)üó£Ô∏èüò°üò®üòÜ

This repository contains code for a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model capable of classifying 7 emotions, including `happy`, `sad`, `angry`, `fear`, `disgust`, `neutral`, and `surprised`. The model uses **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)** for sound feature extraction, along with the **Toronto emotional speech set (TESS)** and **Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS)** datasets. It employs various Machine Learning (ML)(Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, Gradient Boosting, etc.) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches(Dense, GRU, LSTM), with a Dense Model achieving the highest accuracy of approximately **90%**. The project showcases the integration of ML and DL techniques for accurate emotion recognition from speech signals.
